ideal:
    - GLOBAL:
        * mod dev/recette/prod ?
    - POSTGRES:
        * is sanitized ? [CRITICAL]
        * use builtin password cryptography ?
        * resilience: what append if connection is lost ?
        * dont update blocked column in api_users if is not necessary
    - SERVER:
        * sanitize pseudo [CRITICAL]
        * validator pseudo/password [CRITICAL]
        * sanitize/check str1 str2 in the fizzbuzz [CRITICAL]
        * admin can block admin ?
        * resilience: delete new user in postgres if error occured from redis ?
        * unlock limit of fizzbuzz ( > 100), overflow ?
        * optimize double request like get/update
        * use env for init.sql ?
        * fizzbuzz route can be improved (is fat..)
        * add options to the fizzbuzz request:
            . choose the the number of request
            . select specific int1/in2/limit/str1/str2
        * add a disconnection endpoint
    - PGADMIN:
        * change default logs ?
    - REDIS:
        * can have too many tokens by user ?
        * add admins ?
        * sanitize ? (with pseudo keys for exemple) [CRITICAL]
        * resilience: what append if connection is lost ?
        * add stats with refresher
        * add expire on token (redis and cookies...)
    - TEST:
        * structure in several files
